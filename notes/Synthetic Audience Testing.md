# Synthetic Audience Testing

**Synthetic Audience Testing** is the practice of simulating user behavior with AI personas to evaluate products, messaging, or design changes *before* they ship. It’s a fast, low‑risk way to test assumptions when real user testing is slow or expensive.

## Why it matters

- **Pre‑launch confidence**: predict whether a change will help or hurt before it reaches real users.
- **Faster iteration**: run many tests quickly without waiting for traffic.
- **Cost control**: explore more variants without full A/B test overhead.

## How it usually works

1. **Define a target audience** (demographics + behaviors).
2. **Generate AI personas** that represent that audience.
3. **Run simulations**: personas navigate a product, ad, or store like real users.
4. **Compare variants**: rank changes by predicted outcomes (e.g., add‑to‑cart rate).
5. **Review qualitative feedback**: persona reasoning can surface usability issues.

## Limits and cautions

- **Synthetic ≠ real**: results are directional, not definitive.
- **Data dependence**: weak inputs create misleading personas.
- **Over‑trust**: treat this as a filter, not a final decision.
