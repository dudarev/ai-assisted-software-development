# Vibe Coding Is FAAFO

Gene Kim and Steve Yegge coined the term **FAAFO** to describe the five dimensions of value that vibe coding (AI-assisted programming) creates:

- **Fast**: Rapid code generation and iteration
- **Ambitious**: Projects once too difficult become feasible
- **Autonomous**: Technical self-sufficiency across domains—developers can tackle tasks that previously required specialists or experts in areas outside their expertise
- **Fun**: Programming becomes addictive again through rapid feedback loops
- **Optionality**: Low-cost parallel experimentation enables keeping options open

While speed is the most visible benefit, the authors argue it's actually the least interesting. The deeper value lies in the other four dimensions—particularly how vibe coding reshapes what's feasible for individual developers and small teams.

The FAAFO framework provides concrete dimensions for measuring and understanding AI assistance impact beyond simple productivity metrics.

The acronym itself playfully echoes the internet slang "FAFO/FAAFO" (f\*ck around and find out)—a fitting parallel to the experimental, exploratory nature of vibe coding where developers can rapidly try ideas and discover what works.
