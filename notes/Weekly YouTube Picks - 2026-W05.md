# Weekly YouTube Picks (2026-W05)

## Picks

*   **[10 tips to level up your ai-assisted coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8XWvBpL_EA)** — Aleksander Stensby at NDC Manchester 2025 provides a practical framework for "Compounding Engineering," where you treat your AI assistant as a junior colleague. Key takeaways include active context management, maintaining repo-specific rule files, and using MCP to connect agents to real-world tools.

*   **[The Developer Skills That Will Actually Survive AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwJnowQ7Iio)** — A high-level discussion with former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke and Guy Podjarny. They argue that as syntax becomes a commodity, the core engineering skill shifts to problem decomposition and system architecture. The conversation highlights the move toward agent-to-agent collaboration and why developers must remain the architects of value.

*   **[Why Your Best Employees Quit Using AI After 3 Weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ4EjJ0iDDQ)** — This video explores the "missing middle" of AI adoption in the enterprise. It moves beyond basic prompting (101) to the critical 201-level skills of judgment, task decomposition, and workflow integration. It emphasizes that AI success is less about technical tricks and more about management and verification skills.

*   **[Codex vs Claude Code vs Antigravity – Agentic Coding Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYFcJT9XOIk)** — An experimental face-off between three major agentic systems tasked with building an arcade game. It offers a candid look at the friction of formal "planning" versus the agility of "vibe coding." A great reality check on where current agents struggle, particularly with hardware and engine-specific integration.

*   **[The creator of Clawd: "I ship code I don't read"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lF7HmQ_RgY)** — Peter Steinberger (founder of PSPDFKit) shares his radical "Agentic Engineering" workflow. He describes managing 5-10 parallel agents and relying on automated verification ("Closing the Loop") rather than manual code review. It's a provocative look at how high-agency engineers can operate as entire teams.

*   **[Agentic Workflows Just Changed AI Automation Forever! (Claude Code)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO5aW01DKHo)** — This video aligns with current agentic workflow patterns and showcases practical Claude Code usage in automation contexts.

*   **[DON'T Build n8n workflows, Claude builds them for you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkrH3ftxPYc)** — A practical example of workflow automation where the agent executes the build, accelerating the transition from design to implementation.

*   **[Ralph Loop makes Claude Code 100x more powerful - Future of VIBE CODING?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKGrj6ygxs)** — A deep dive into the "vibe coding loops" theme, exploring how tools like Ralph Loop can amplify the effectiveness of agentic coding.
