title: "Four Modes of AI Assistance"

AI can play different roles during software work. The failure mode is treating every task as if it wants the same level of rigor.

These four modes are a practical way to choose the right “contract” with the model for the moment.

## 1) Brainstorming

Use when you want options, framing, and contrast, not correctness.

- Goal: expand the space of ideas
- Output: rough lists, questions, alternatives
- Risks: plausible nonsense; hidden assumptions

## 2) Drafting

Use when you want a first version you will edit (text, code, docs).

- Goal: reduce blank-page cost
- Output: a coherent draft you can shape
- Risks: overconfident tone; missed edge cases

## 3) Pairing

Use when you want a thinking partner while you stay responsible for decisions.

- Goal: faster iteration with checks
- Output: small deltas, tight feedback loops
- Risks: context drift; “fixing” the wrong thing

## 4) Surgical changes

Use when the change must be minimal, reviewable, and safe.

- Goal: precise edits with clear boundaries
- Output: targeted patches, diffs, test updates
- Risks: missing broader implications; local optimums

## Choosing quickly

If you can’t articulate the mode, default to pairing: small steps, frequent verification, explicit assumptions.
