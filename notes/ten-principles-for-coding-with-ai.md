1. **Make the goal testable.** “Working” is vague; define what success looks like.
2. **Constrain the change.** Prefer small, reviewable edits over rewrites.
3. **Keep sources of truth explicit.** Decide what is authoritative: code, docs, config, tests.
4. **Ask for trade-offs, not just answers.** Alternatives reveal constraints and risks.
5. **Separate discovery from delivery.** Explore broadly, then switch to surgical execution.
6. **Verify in the loop.** Run the narrowest test that can falsify the current assumption.
7. **Treat generated code as a hypothesis.** Read it like you didn’t write it.
8. **Preserve intent and naming.** Don’t “improve” structure unless asked.
9. **Make decisions reversible.** Prefer changes you can roll back quickly.
10. **Write down the why.** Lightweight notes prevent re-deciding the same thing later.
