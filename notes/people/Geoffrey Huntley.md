## Bio

Geoffrey Huntley is an Australian software engineer and researcher known for challenging the status quo in software development and technology policy. Formerly known for **The NFT Bay** (a project demonstrating the fragility of NFT ownership), he has shifted his focus in 2025-2026 to the forefront of **Agentic Coding**.

He is a vocal advocate for "high-performance" engineering using AI, arguing that the traditional identity of a software developer (e.g., "I am a .NET developer") is becoming obsolete. Instead, he promotes the idea of **"Identity Erasure"**—shedding specific tech stack allegiances to become a generalized engineer who orchestrates AI agents.

## Key Concepts & Contributions

### The Ralph Wiggum Loop ("Ralphing")
Huntley coined the term "Ralph" (or **Ralphing**) to describe a deterministic, iterative loop where an AI agent attempts to solve a problem until a verification step passes.
*   **Philosophy:** "Deterministic badness in an undeterministic world."
*   **Technique:** A simple bash loop (`while :; do ... done`) that runs an agent until it outputs a specific completion promise.
*   **Evolution:** This concept was formalized into the official **Ralph Loop** plugin for Claude Code.

### Identity Erasure
The concept that AI lowers the barrier to entry for any language or framework so significantly that "specializing" is no longer a competitive advantage.
*   "If you are still using Claude Code in y/n mode, your employment is at risk."
*   He argues that junior engineers may have an advantage as they have less "identity" to unlearn.

### The "300 Lines of Code" Agent
A workshop and educational initiative where he demonstrates that a powerful, autonomous coding agent isn't magic, but can be built in ~300 lines of code using basic primitives (file I/O, shell execution, LLM loop).
