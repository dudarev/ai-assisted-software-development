# New Notes Ideas

These are five important principles identified from recent research and industry articles that are not yet fully expressed in the current notes.

## 1. Automation via Verification (The "Software 2.0" Pivot)
- **Description**: The primary work of a software engineer is shifting from **writing code** (generation) to **building validation criteria** (verification). The engineer's job is now "curating the garden"—building the constraints (tests, lints, builds) that allow agents to search for and find the correct solution.

## 2. AI-Native Team Structure: The "One-Pizza Pod"
- **Description**: Moving away from the traditional 8–10 person "two-pizza" Agile team toward smaller, denser **3–5 person "one-pizza pods."** These pods leverage AI to reduce coordination costs and maintain the same throughput as larger groups.
- **Source**: Moving away from Agile: What's Next – Martin Harrysson & Natasha Maniar, McKinsey & Company

## 3. Role Transformation: Orchestrator vs. Executor
- **Description**: A shift in professional identity where the human moves from an **Executor** (writing logic line-by-line) to an **Orchestrator** (defining architecture, setting specs, and managing a "factory of agents" to implement the details).

## 4. Engineering for Non-Determinism (Tolerances Thinking)
- **Description**: Treating AI-generated code as a physical engineering material with "safety margins" rather than a deterministic mathematical proof. This requires a shift from "knowing" code works to "ensuring" it works through rigorous safety harnesses.
- **Source**: How AI will change software engineering – with Martin Fowler

## 5. Maximizing Option Value via Parallel Exploration
- **Description**: Using AI to convert "one-way door" decisions into "two-way door" decisions by prototyping multiple architectural paths in parallel. Cheap iteration allows comparing hands-on implementations before committing to a single path.
