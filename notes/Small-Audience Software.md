# Small-Audience Software

**Small-Audience Software** is software built for a *tiny, specific group* (sometimes just one person) where the goal is usefulness and taste, not scale. It becomes viable because implementation costs have collapsed, making “small but delighted” a valid target.

This aligns with two adjacent ideas:
- **“1,000 True Fans”**: a small, devoted audience can sustain a creator.
- **“Smallest Viable Audience”**: focus on the minimum group that would truly value the work.

## Why it matters

- **Economics shifted**: AI makes building cheap, so *distribution* and *clarity of intent* matter more than scale.
- **Taste wins**: small audience software can encode personal taste and constraints without compromise.
- **Speed over polish**: iteration is fast; the product can be cut down to the few features that matter.

## Characteristics

- **Built for a specific person or micro‑community**
- **Opinionated**: defaults reflect the builder’s taste, not mass appeal
- **Disposable or regenerable**: replace rather than maintain when messy
- **Low‑stakes infra**: minimal onboarding, minimal ops

## Tradeoffs

- **Pros**: fast feedback, deep fit, low overhead, high joy
- **Cons**: limited distribution, unclear monetization, can be brittle without specs

## Common failure modes

- **Accidental mass‑market**: sanding off edges destroys the unique value
- **Overbuilding**: too many features before the core loop is proven
- **No retention mechanic**: small audiences still need a reason to return
