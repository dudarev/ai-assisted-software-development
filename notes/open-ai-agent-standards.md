# Open AI Agent Standards

A list of emerging open standards for AI agents.

## Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) Standards

The [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation-aaif-anchored-by-new-project-contributions-including-model-context-protocol-mcp-goose-and-agents-md/) is a Linux Foundation project with founding contributions from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI.

**[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)** – Anthropic  
Open standard API for connecting AI agents to data sources and tools. Acts as a "USB-C port for AI" to standardize context delivery.

**[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents#agentsmd)** – OpenAI  
Markdown-based convention for providing project-specific instructions to coding agents. Used by 60k+ open-source projects.

**[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose)** – Block  
Open-source agent framework connecting LLMs to real-world actions via MCP. Reference implementation for building custom agents.

## Other Open Standards

**[Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-agent2agent-protocol)** – Google Cloud  
Protocol for peer-to-peer communication between AI agents, defining message formats and negotiation patterns.

**[AGNTCY](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-welcomes-the-agntcy-project-to-standardize-open-multi-agent-system-infrastructure-and-break-down-ai-agent-silos)** – Cisco/Linux Foundation  
Infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration: discovery, identity, secure messaging (SLIM protocol), and observability.

## Emerging

**[skills.md](https://agentskills.io/home)** – Currently redirects to agentskills.io  
Likely to become a standard for defining agent capabilities and skills.
