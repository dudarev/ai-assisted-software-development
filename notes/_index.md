This knowledge base is a public working notebook for AI-assisted software development.

It focuses on practices that stay useful even as tools change: how to think, decide, and iterate when AI is part of the workflow.

## What these notes are

- Principles, patterns, and mental models
- Experiments and workflows for using AI in software development
- Snapshots of thinking that evolve over time

## What these notes are not

- A polished course
- A static reference
- A collection of generic AI prompts

Clarity and usefulness matter more than completeness.
