[Coding with AI // Chip Huyen - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY1FcjIbErQ) - Mentioned as the best keynote in MLOps community. 

“coding genie” analogy (Ken Beck) – powerful but mischievous: often “mostly works,” so you must tame it. As mentioned by Lada Kesseler https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LSK2bVf0Lc 

In general, think about collecting different analogies and metaphors appropriate for working with AI in the context of AI-assisted software development. https://chatgpt.com/c/69596ec5-db3c-8325-a8ab-c3e075dc77ad

Think about creating an automatic page with a list of all the notes.

Create create RTT similar to YTT, a tool to get reddit threads and in addition to the threads it can get also subreddits and one of the exercises can be to get top posts in some of the subreddits and determine which are appropriate for this knowledge base. 

I wonder if I can create a tool XTT that uses Playwright and gets Twitter threads. Or maybe uses a browser and does it automatically. 

Create documentation about Obsidian, for example about bases and functions that can be used there and how easily one can copy them from one folder to another.
