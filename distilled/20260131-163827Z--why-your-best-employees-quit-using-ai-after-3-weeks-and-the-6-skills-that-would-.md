## Summary

This note analyzes why 80% of enterprise employees abandon AI tools after an initial period of excitement, often within three weeks. The core argument is that potential is lost not due to a lack of technical skills or prompting ability (101 level), but due to a "missing middle" of applied judgment and management skills (201 level). Successful AI adoption requires treating AI as an inexperienced collaborator that needs management, validation, and specific workflow integration, rather than a magic tool.

## Key Concepts

### The Skills Hierarchy
- **101 Level (Basics):** Tool tours, prompting fundamentals, generic use cases. Most training stops here.
- **201 Level (The Missing Middle):** Applied judgment, workflow integration, trusting vs. verifying, task decomposition. This is where productivity gains live.
- **401 Level (Technical):** API integrations, RAG architectures, fine-tuning. For developers and technical builders.

### The Jagged Frontier
Based on BCG and Harvard research, AI has a "jagged frontier" of capabilities.
- Inside the frontier, AI speeds up work and improves quality.
- Outside the frontier, users are often *19 percentage points less likely* to be correct than those working without AI.
- The danger is that users develop a single mental model (e.g., "AI is good at writing") and apply it evenly, failing to recognize the jagged boundaries where AI fails.

### Work Patterns: Centaurs vs. Cyborgs
Two successful patterns for 201-level users:
1.  **Centaurs:** Clearly divide work between human and AI. Human does strategy/framing; AI does generation. Best for high-stakes, accountable work (Legal, Medical).
2.  **Cyborgs:** Completely integrated workflow with continuous interaction. Fluid boundary between human and AI. Best for creative, iterative, and building tasks.

## The 6 '201-Level' Skills

These are primarily **management skills**, not technical ones.

1.  **Context Assembly:** Knowing what information, constraints, and examples to provide to get high-quality output. Moving beyond "dumping documents" or providing zero context.
2.  **Quality Judgment:** Knowing when to trust and when to verify. Understanding that AI can state accurate info and hallucinate in the same paragraph.
3.  **Task Decomposition:** Breaking work into AI-appropriate chunks rather than throwing an entire complex task at the tool.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Treating the first output as a draft (like an intern's work) and using structured passes to improve it from 70% to 95%.
5.  **Workflow Integration:** Embedding AI into *how* work gets done (e.g., "This is how we do RFPs now") rather than treating it as a side activity.
6.  **Frontier Recognition:** Building explicit knowledge of where AI excels vs. fails for specific domains to avoid performance drops.

## Organizational Barriers & Solutions

### The Barriers
-   **The Permission Gap:** Employees fear doing it wrong or getting in trouble. "Are we allowed to do that?" is a showstopper.
-   **The Apprentice Model Collapse:** Juniors used to learn by doing routine work now delegated to AI. Organizations risk a future "judgment deficit."
-   **Generic Tool Stalling:** Individual learnings don't naturally scale to the organization because AI instances reset every session.

### Strategic Moves
1.  **Create AI Labs:** fast-moving teams with power users (including non-technical ones) to experiment with workflows.
2.  **Systematic Discovery:** Interview every department to find hidden use cases. Example: Trek Bicycle interviewed every single team and uncovered 40+ specific opportunities that leadership wouldn't have known about.
3.  **Make Success Visible:** Use social proof. "What's a workflow you've improved?"
4.  **Invest in Hours:** Employees with >5 hours of training are significantly more likely to adopt.
5.  **Define Guardrails Explicitly:** Shift from "Don't do this" to "Here is what positive usage looks like."
6.  **Share Failure Cases:** Systematically share what *doesn't* work so the team learns the boundaries.

## Notable Quotes

> "AI isn't a tool skill. It's a management skill."

> "The unlock isn't more tool training—it's building the judgment layer that makes those tools reliable."

> "The skills that predict AI success aren't new skills at all. They're the same skills that have always made people effective leaders."

> "IT and CISOs think in terms of systems, inputs, outputs, deterministic processes... AI works like a person."

> "You'd wouldn't hand a 100-page RFP to a brand new intern and just say, 'Handle this.'... That's really the mindset we should all be using."
