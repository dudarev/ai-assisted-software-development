## Summary

Simon Willison describes a shift in engineering intuition: ideas that used to feel “not worth building” now get tried anyway via Claude Code, because the marginal cost of implementation has dropped. Replies extend the point from small tweaks to whole features and even infrastructure, highlighting how “try it” and “stretch goal” experiments become cheap enough to justify. The thread also pushes back on the idea that effort disappears: maintenance and ongoing support costs persist, and cheaper creation increases the need for taste, filtering, and deliberate pruning. A secondary theme is what the new bottleneck is—some argue it’s near-zero “gumption” to write software; others argue gumption (and judgment) matters more than ever.

## Key points

<!-- TODO: so it seems it's not only important to experiment with tools but also to to re-evaluate one's intuition regularly.  -->

- **Intuition recalibration**: Scarcity-trained instincts (“not worth it”) can become a tax when build cost collapses.
- **Lowered experimentation threshold**: Trying feature ideas and stretch goals becomes cheap enough that “prototype first” wins more often.
- **Maintenance remains a constraint**: Ongoing support is cheaper but not free; feature creation can outpace maintenance capacity.
- **Filtering/taste becomes central**: Lower marginal build cost increases the importance of deciding what *not* to ship.
- **Gumption shifts, not disappears**: The limiting factor may move from typing/implementation to initiative, framing, and follow-through.
- **Deletion/refactoring is part of the workflow**: If adding is cheaper, teams may need symmetric investment in removing and simplifying.

## Concepts / principles

- **Marginal cost vs total cost**: Faster implementation changes the economics of “should we try this?”, but total cost still includes maintenance, upgrades, and user expectations.
- **Taste as a scaling limiter**: If the cost to create drops faster than the ability to judge and prune, output volume rises without necessarily improving outcomes.
- **Agency as leverage**: When “open a PR” is about as easy as “write it down”, personal initiative and curiosity can drive more exploration than planning.

## Patterns

- **Prompt-to-prototype loop**: Treat “worth it?” as an empirical question—prompt an agent to build a thin slice, then decide.
- **PR-as-note**: Instead of maintaining a backlog of ideas, test feasibility by shipping (or at least opening) a PR.
- **Try-and-retract**: Open a PR, evaluate quickly, and close/revert if it’s not worth the ongoing cost.
- **Add-and-prune symmetry**: Pair “ship tiny features” with explicit prompting time for deletion, refactoring, and simplification.

## Entities

- **Claude Code**: Agentic coding environment repeatedly referenced as reducing build friction.
- **“Codex by Opus”**: Mentioned as a prompting approach, without enough detail to assess specifics.
- **Maintenance cost**: The lifetime ownership burden of features (bugs, upgrades, UX drift).
- **Gumption**: The willingness to start, iterate, and finish work; debated as the new bottleneck.

## Open questions / follow-ups

- What lightweight “filters” (review, metrics, taste checks) prevent cheap prototyping from turning into permanent feature creep?
- How should teams budget for maintenance when adding features becomes dramatically easier?
- What heuristics help decide when “try it quickly” is worth it vs when restraint is better?
- What does a good “pruning workflow” look like in an agent-accelerated codebase?

## Next steps

- Draft a single `notes/` synthesis note combining the main idea in this thread and Alex Albert’s thread (collapsed cost of trying/building; bottleneck shifts; maintenance/taste trade-offs).
- Convert this into a `notes/` concept note on **feature-economics under AI** (marginal build cost vs lifetime maintenance).
- Capture concrete pruning techniques (feature flags, sunset policies, “delete-first” refactors) that complement fast generation.
- Look for examples of teams explicitly tracking “maintenance capacity” as a constraint in an AI-assisted workflow.
