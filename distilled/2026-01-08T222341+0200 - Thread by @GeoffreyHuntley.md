# Summary

Geoffrey Huntley highlights a major shift in software engineering practices that has been occurring over the last year. He introduces the concept of **Ralphing**—a process of using AI agents to clone entire SaaS companies and platforms rather than just building features. He emphasizes that high-performance engineering now involves running multiple concurrent AI agent instances (e.g., 10 Claude Code instances) without manual confirmation ("y/n mode"). This shift leads to "identity erasure," where specialized developer roles (e.g., ".NET developer") are replaced by a more general "engineering" identity, giving juniors an advantage as they have less traditional identity to unlearn.

# Key Points

- **The Rise of Ralphing**: A class of companies and YC batches has been using the "Ralph" method for 6–12 months in secret to clone and build platforms rapidly.
- **High-Performance Scaling**: Modern high-performance coding is defined by spinning up 10+ concurrent Claude Code instances.
- **Obsolescence of "y/n" Mode**: Relying on manual confirmation in agentic workflows is seen as a risk to employment; high performance requires automation.
- **Identity Erasure**: The distinction between language-specific developers (e.g., Go vs. .NET) is disappearing in favor of generalized engineering.
- **Junior Advantage**: Junior developers may adapt faster because they don't have established "software engineer" identities that need to be erased.
- **Biological Parallels**: Users noted that these agentic scaffolds mirror biological systems, such as chaperone-mediated protein folding (GroEL isolating mis-folded proteins).

# Concepts

<!-- TODO: To capture the idea of Ralfin seems to be a good note to take. -->

- **Ralphing**: A method or tool for cloning entire SaaS companies/platforms using AI agents.
- **Identity Erasure Functions**: The process of stripping away specialized developer identities (e.g., "I am a Java dev") to become a generalized engineer.
- **y/n Mode**: Manual confirmation bottlenecks in AI agent workflows.
- **High-Performance Claude Code Usage**: Concurrent execution of multiple agent instances to solve complex problems or build systems.
- **Claude Code Stop Hooks**: Technical mechanisms that facilitate iterative agentic workflows.
- **Orchestrator vs. Executor**: A useful framing for the role shift implied by parallel agent execution; see [[Orchestrator vs. Executor]].

# Patterns

- **Parallel Agent Execution**: Running multiple instances of coding agents (e.g., 10 Claude instances) simultaneously.
- **Infinite Looping Iterative Improvements**: The "AutoGPT" style pattern of continuously refining code until a goal is met.
- **Biological Scaffolding**: Designing agentic workflows based on biological systems (like protein folding).
- **Clone-First Development**: Scaling from "cloning features" to "cloning entire companies."

# Entities

- **Geoffrey Huntley**: Author of the thread, advocate for high-performance agentic engineering.
- **Claude Code**: The primary tool mentioned for agentic coding.
- **Ralph**: A tool or process for automated company/platform cloning.
- **z80**: A specific article/video by Huntley on cloning companies.
- **YC (Y Combinator)**: Mentioned as having companies using these techniques in secret.
