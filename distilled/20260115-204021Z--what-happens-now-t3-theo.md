# What happens now? (Theo - t3.gg)

## Summary
The barrier to entry for writing code has collapsed due to AI, but the cost of creating "real" software remains high. We are shifting from an era of long-lived, expensive SAS platforms to an era of **personal, disposable software**—bespoke tools built to solve immediate problems and then discarded. Engineering is shifting from syntax mastery to system orchestration, where **taste, distribution, and motivation** are the primary differentiators.

## Key Points
- **The Code/Software Inverse**: Code is now prolific and cheap, but software (the resilient, maintained, real-world utility) is as expensive as ever.
- **Disposable Software**: We are move away from "software at scale" toward "software as a scratchpad." If it takes 5 minutes to generate a custom solution, you don't need to maintain it; you just regenerate it when needed.
- **Engineering as Orchestration**: Senior engineers succeed by leveraging their ability to structure systems and orchestrate AI "teammates" who are high-capability but low-planning.
- **The Distribution Bottleneck**: When anyone can generate an app in a weekend, the challenge shifts from *building* to *getting people to care*.
- **The "Land the Plane" Delusion**: The belief that removing technical friction allows anyone to perform high-skill roles. In reality, motivation and deep domain interest (e.g., watching 8 hours of YouTube daily to be a YouTuber) are the true barriers.
- **Technical Rigor is Still Required**: While AI hides complexity, the engineer's job is to manage that complexity, not ignore it. Scaling, data ownership, and edge cases still require a "human in the loop."

## Concepts & Patterns
- **Personal Disposable Software**: Small, niche tools (subscription trackers, Chrome extensions) built for a single user's specific workflow.
- **CLI-First Workflow**: The resurgence of CLI tools (Claude Code, Open Code/Aider) as the primary interface for rapid development.
- **Endpoint Dynamics**: A shift from static binaries to endpoints that might generate new code specific to the shape of a user's request.
- **Motivation Over Expertise**: The idea that a highly motivated "vibe coder" using AI can outpace a checked-out senior engineer.
- **AI-Managed Brittleness**: Future systems may use AI to automatically adjust to breaking changes (e.g., CSV format shifts or DOM changes) instead of requiring manual maintenance.

## Entities
- **Chris Gregori**: Author of the inspiring article "Code is cheap now, software isn't."
- **Peter Steinberger (@steipete)**: Example of a developer shipping dozens of open-source AI utilities (Clawdbot/Clawd, Codex Bar).
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI tool mentioned frequently as a game-changer.
- **Open Code / Aider**: Other CLI-first AI coding tools.
- **Retool**: Cited as a billion-dollar company whose value (easy internal dashboards) is being challenged by bespoke AI-generated alternatives.
- **WebDev Cody**: A YouTuber cited for being "perpetually 6 months ahead" in building AI orchestration tools (AutoMaker).

## Quotes
- "The barrier to entry for building software has collapsed. The barrier to building something that matters hasn't moved an inch."
- "We're entering an era of personal disposable software, where engineering shifts from writing code to shaping systems."
- "Software is becoming a personal utility that you generate rather than a commodity you buy."
- "If you're not already certified, you're not going to land that [__] plane." (Regarding the "Land the Plane" Delusion).
- "Taste, timing, and deep intuitive understanding of your audience matters way more than ever."
- "Motivation is going to be the key differentiator. Do you care enough to skill up in the areas you don't know?"
