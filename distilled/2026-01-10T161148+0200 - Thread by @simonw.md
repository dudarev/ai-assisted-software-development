## Summary

Simon Willison highlights “Sprites” as a promising building block for agentic development: disposable developer sandbox environments plus a JSON API for executing untrusted code. Replies reinforce that the core value proposition is reliability and recoverability—being able to snapshot, fork, and roll back when agents inevitably break their environment. The thread also situates Sprites among adjacent products (e.g., `exe.dev`) and homegrown approaches (hosting an internal machine with an API). A practical undercurrent is that many “agent frameworks” feel mismatched to how teams actually want to configure and deploy agents, while sandbox+API primitives map more directly to real deployment.

## Key points

- Sprites is framed as solving two recurring needs: **agent-friendly dev sandboxes** and **untrusted-code execution via API**.
- Snapshotting and rollback are treated as essential UX for agent workflows (“when things go sideways”).
- “Durable sandbox” is a helpful mental model: sandboxes need persistence, restore points, and repeatability—not just isolation.
- A sandbox product is more directly deployable than many “agent frameworks” because it integrates at the infrastructure boundary.
- There’s demand for **forkable environments** (start from a known snapshot and branch for new tasks).
- Teams already approximate this internally by exposing a machine/workspace over a lightweight API (e.g., FastAPI).
- The ecosystem appears to be converging on “remote dev environment for agents” as a distinct product category.

## Concepts / principles

- **Isolation + recoverability beats isolation alone**: For agents, the common failure mode is environmental drift (dependencies, state changes, broken configs). Snapshots/checkpoints turn that into a reversible operation.
- **API-first execution primitives**: A JSON API for running untrusted code suggests composing higher-level agent systems out of smaller, auditable building blocks.
- **Deployment-shaped abstractions**: Tools win when they match how people actually operate systems (configure, deploy, observe, reset), not just how they want to write prompts.

## Patterns

- **Checkpoint-driven agent loop**: snapshot → let agent act → evaluate → restore/branch as needed.
- **Fork-from-known-good**: maintain a curated base snapshot for a repo/project, fork per task or per agent run.
- **“Durable sandbox” boundary**: put risky execution behind a single API boundary, rather than letting agents mutate primary dev machines.

## Entities

- **Sprites**: “developer sandbox environments for coding agents” + “a JSON API for executing untrusted code” (per @simonw).
- **Snapshots/checkpoints/forking**: suggested as the key feature for controlling agent-induced environment drift.
- **`exe.dev`**: mentioned as a related “general VM product” designed with agents in mind.
- **FastAPI**: referenced in an example of an internal, API-exposed machine/workspace for agent tasks.
- **Claude Code**: referenced as the environment someone uses on a VM built for agent workflows.
- **Chris McCord**: referenced in relation to a demo.

> "restore to checkpoints when things go sideways" is doing a lot of work in that pitch. feels like the main feature tbh given how often agents wreck their own environment

> Part of my frustration with existing agent frameworks and sub-agent systems is that they don't map well to how people actually want to configure and deploy agents.

## Open questions / follow-ups

- What are the security guarantees and isolation model (VMs, containers, Firecracker, etc.) behind “untrusted code” execution?
- What is the UX for snapshotting, diffing, and restoring—manual, automatic, policy-driven?
- How do sandboxes integrate with secrets management, network egress controls, and audit logging?
- What’s the pricing model, and how does it scale with concurrency and storage for snapshots?
- Where should the boundary be between “sandbox infrastructure” and “agent framework” responsibilities?

## Next steps

- Capture and distill the linked blog post for deeper technical details: `https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/9/sprites-dev/`
- Create a `notes/` concept note on **durable sandboxes** (snapshots, rollback, forkability) as a core agent-infrastructure pattern.
- Compare Sprites, `exe.dev`, and self-hosted “agent PC + API” setups by trade-offs (cost, security, ergonomics, portability).
