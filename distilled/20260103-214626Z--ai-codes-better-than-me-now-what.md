## Summary

In this transcript from 2026, Lee Robinson reflects on how AI agents have fundamentally shifted software engineering. He notes that AI models (like the referenced Opus 4.5 and Cursor agents) now write code better than humans, enabling him to build complex projects (a Rust image compressor, Game Boy games) in unfamiliar domains without writing code by hand. He argues that software engineering is not dying but evolving: the focus is shifting from writing code to "product engineering"—using taste, generalist skills, and AI leverage to build and ship complete products. He also emphasizes using AI as an active learning tool rather than a crutch.

## Key points

- **Ambition Unlocked**: AI agents allow engineers to tackle complex projects in unfamiliar languages (e.g., Rust, Verilog) or domains without deep prior expertise.
- **Shift to Generalist Product Engineers**: As code generation becomes cheap, value shifts to "taste," UX, marketing, and the ability to ship a full product.
- **Drudgery Removal**: Agents should be used to handle boilerplate, debugging, and setup tasks, freeing time for higher-level problem solving.
- **Active Learning**: Instead of just outsourcing work, use agents to generate custom courses and explainers to deepen understanding of new topics faster.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Engineers who embrace these tools early will have a significant productivity lead over skeptics.

## Concepts / principles

**The Product Engineer Shift**
The role of a software engineer is blending into that of a "Product Engineer." When the "how" of implementation becomes easier/cheaper via AI, the "what" and "why" (product decisions, user experience, distribution) become the primary differentiators.

**Ambitious Generalism**
Barriers to entry for specific tech stacks (like Rust or hardware programming) are lowered. Engineers can now be ambitious across the entire stack, moving from idea to implementation regardless of their previous specialization.

**AI as a Tutor, Not Just a Worker**
A critical pattern for growth is using the AI to *teach* you the underlying concepts (e.g., "explain Verilog syntax," "create a mini-course on hardware layers") rather than just accepting the output blindly. This prevents strict dependency and builds "taste."

## Entities

- **Cursor**: The primary AI code editor/agent discussed.
- **Product Engineer**: The target archetype for modern software engineers.
- **Rust / WebAssembly**: Example of a high-complexity domain made accessible by AI.
- **Verilog / Analog Pocket**: Hardware programming example cited as a new capability unlocked by agents.

## Quotes

> "I'm not really writing code by hand anymore... I built all of this without writing any code by hand, entirely using coding agents."

> "Now that code is cheap, what really matters is your taste and increasingly as an engineer that is blending over to be more of a generalist."

> "You want to use these tools to get rid of all the drudge work, the stuff that you don't want to do."

> "If you rely on LLMs too much, they can kind of trick you into thinking that you understand a topic... You want to use them to become smarter."

> "Writing code was never the bottleneck... It's about building something great."

## Open questions / follow-ups

- How does the "Product Engineer" role scale in large organizations where specialization is structural?
- What are the long-term risks of "forgetting" low-level details if agents handle them exclusively?
- How to maintain "taste" in code quality if one rarely writes it by hand?

## Next steps

- Explore "Product Engineer" skills: marketing, design, and user analytics.
- Experiment with using an AI agent to build a project in a completely unfamiliar language or framework.
- Create a prompt workflow for "Just-in-Time Learning" (e.g., requesting mini-courses on new topics).
