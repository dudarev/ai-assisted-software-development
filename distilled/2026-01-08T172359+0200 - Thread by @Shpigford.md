## Summary

Josh Pigford (@Shpigford) introduces a workflow for running End-to-End (E2E) tests using **Claude Code** and **Playwright**, where test suites are written in plan English Markdown rather than brittle scripts. Traditional E2E tests are criticized as a maintenance burden in fast-moving projects; however, in an AI-assisted world, they become critical "final verifications" that allow agents to audit their own work from a user's perspective. The community debate distinguishes between dynamic interpretation (intent-based) and "compiling" natural language into deterministic scripts for CI efficiency.

## Key points

- **Brittle Selectors vs. Intent**: Traditional tests break when CSS selectors change. Natural language tests allow the AI to "figure it out" based on intent, making tests more resilient to UI shifts.
- **The /e2e Workflow**: Pigford uses a custom command to run full-app sanity checks manually a few times a day to augment traditional unit tests.
- **AI Self-Verification**: E2E testing is the "final proof" in an AI-driven development cycle, closing the loop by having the agent verify its changes in a real browser.
- **Plan Mode**: A recommendation to use Claude's "plan mode" religiously for maintaining consistency in complex tasks.
- **VibeCucumber**: A fusion of "Vibe Coding" and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), replacing rigid Step Definitions with LLM interpretation.
- **Token Indifference**: Pigford notes that for many developers, token cost is no longer a primary friction point compared to the time saved on test maintenance.

## Concepts / principles

- **Intent-Based Abstraction**: The shift from specifying *how* to find a button to *what* the goal of the interaction is.
- **Verification-Centered Development**: The idea that in a world of high-velocity AI generation, the developer's primary job shifts from writing code to building robust verification suites.
- **Hallucinations as Skill Issues**: The counter-argument that AI unreliability can be mitigated through better prompting and system instructions rather than just blaming the model.

## Patterns

- **Custom Agent Aliases**: Creating specific commands (like `/e2e`) within the agent environment to trigger complex investigative or testing workflows.
<!-- TODO: There was another similar discussion about executable markdown. It's a publish note Executable Specs. A note that can be derived from this distillation potentially can be linked to it. or maybe executable specs note can be enriched by the ideas from here. -->
- **English-to-Deterministic Compilation**: (Proposed by Nate Berkopec) Using AI to generate a static Playwright script from English only when the spec changes, ensuring CI runs are fast and deterministic.
- **Manual Sanity Check Loop**: Running agentic E2E tests as a regular human-triggered ritual rather than a mandatory blocking CI step.

## Entities

- **Claude Code**: The primary agent used for the execution.
- **Playwright**: The underlying automation engine.
- **VibeCucumber**: The emergent name for this pattern.
- **Arc Browser**: Mentioned regarding extension compatibility.
- **Cucumber**: The traditional BDD framework referenced as the spiritual predecessor.

## Quotes

> "traditional E2E tests are a giant pain to maintain. they're incredibly fragile and just not a good fit for any codebase that's rapidly changing/expanding."

> "AI hallucinations are a human skill issue"

> "The markdown approach solves the biggest E2E pain - tests breaking after every UI change... having claude interpret intent instead of pixel positions is the right abstraction layer." — @udaysy

## Open questions / follow-ups

- **CI Integration**: How can we move from manual "sanity checks" to a fully automated, agent-led CI pipeline that handles natural language specs?
- **Determinism**: Can we guarantee a "pass" means a "pass" if the agent's path to success changes every time?
- **Tooling Support**: How do emerging "Spec Kit" tools compare to this ad-hoc Markdown approach?

## Next steps

- Explore the **"Burn and Rebuild"** pattern in the context of legacy test suites.
- Draft a note on **[[Spec-Driven Development]]** incorporating the VibeCucumber philosophy.
- Link this to **[[distilled/20260107-082632Z--coding-with-ai-chip-huyen]]** under the "Verification" section.
