<!-- I am not sure I personally agree with the questions he brought up in this thread. it's a skill to work with tickets and I believe a skill that's worth being developed especially considering that good the tickets that are well described can be a good piece of context to give to AI agents to implement. -->

## Summary

Varunram Ganesh claims that a small team (4 people) shipped substantially faster after stopping the practice of creating tickets in an issue tracker (Linear). Instead, work is coordinated through Slack conversations, explicit self-assignment, and public status updates, with day-to-day tracking handled in standups. The thread frames ticketing as overhead that can encourage deflection and blame, while a lightweight, high-visibility “name attached” workflow increases ownership. Replies highlight likely scaling limits (cross-team coordination, compliance/audit trails, retention) and suggest lighter middle grounds (Slack-based trackers, canvases, simple docs).

## Key points

- **Self-reported outcome**: After removing tickets, PR shipping speed increased (claimed 250%) while “net bugs introduced” stayed similar.
- **Coordination mechanism**: Discuss work directly in Slack, self-assign, and post updates where the team can see progress.
- **Tickets as blame surface**: The thread argues tickets can enable priority/ownership disputes (“not my task”) rather than shipping.
- **Small-team fit**: The author notes the team is 4 people; commenters repeatedly question how the approach scales.
- **Tracking still exists**: Work is tracked via standups (and, in replies, alternatives like Slack Canvas, markdown backlogs).
- **Legibility and audit concerns**: Commenters point out loss of durable visibility, cross-team alignment, and compliance needs (e.g., SOC 2, retention).

## Concepts / principles

- **Public commitments over private queues**: Replace “ticket ownership” with visible, named status updates in a shared channel.
- **Minimize coordination overhead early**: If the team is in constant communication, formal trackers can be net-negative.
- **Process should match constraints**: Auditability, retention, and multi-team dependencies change the trade-off.

## Patterns

- **Ticketless Slack loop**: Discuss → self-assign → ship → post update (with daily standup as the coordination checkpoint).
- **Doc-as-backlog**: Maintain a simple markdown file / Slack Canvas instead of a full issue tracker.
- **“Middle ground” integrations**: Use lightweight Slack-based tracking bots/agents when manual tracking starts to strain.

## Open questions / follow-ups

- What conditions made “ticketless” work here (scope, product maturity, on-call load, stakeholder count)?
- How does this approach handle longer-running work, cross-team dependencies, or external stakeholders?
- What’s the minimum durable record needed for compliance, incident review, and prioritization?
