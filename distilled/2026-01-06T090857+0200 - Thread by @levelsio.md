## Summary

The thread discusses using high-quality voice-to-text (STT) and mobile interfaces to interact with AI coding agents, specifically **Claude Code**, running on a VPS. **@levelsio** demonstrates a setup using **Wispr Flow** (a specialized AI iOS keyboard) with **Termius** to live-edit production code from an iPhone. The conversation highlights the emerging trend of "on-the-go" **vibe coding**, the utility of high-bandwidth voice input for instruction delivery, and various community-developed tools to facilitate mobile terminal workflows.

## Key points

<!-- TODO: A related concept is a chat interface as an interface to AI assisting with software development. This should be connected in the nodes somehow. -->

- **Voice over Keyboard**: Voice dictation via Wispr Flow is significantly more reliable and faster for technical prompts than the native iOS dictation or software keyboards.
- **On-the-go Velocity**: Mobile coding velocity is enhanced by bypassing the physical keyboard bottleneck, allowing for rapid iteration on production from any location.
- **Persistent VPS Sessions**: Running agents on a VPS (e.g., via Hetzner) allows for persistent, high-compute sessions accessible from any device.
- **Specialized Tooling**: The community is rapidly building wrappers (web terminals, browser extensions, specialized apps like xtro.dev) to make mobile agent interaction more ergonomic.
- **YOLO Production Edits**: A notable segment of users values the ability to command agents to "fix this sh#t right now" in production directly from their phones.

## Concepts / principles

- **Mobile Agency**: The shift of high-level software engineering tasks from specialized workstations to mobile devices via agentic interfaces.
- **Voice as a Code Interface**: Voice is transitioning from a simple chat modality to a high-bandwidth instruction delivery mechanism for complex coding tasks.
- **Vibe Coding Persistence**: The ability to maintain creative flow ("vibing") across device transitions (desktop to mobile) by using agentic handlers.
- **Structural Emotion in Agents**: The idea of giving agents "personality" or "emotion-sensing" capabilities to better handle urgent or high-pressure situations (e.g., detecting if a user is nervous during a deploy).

## Patterns

- **The VPS-Agent-SSH Loop**: Running a headless coding agent (Claude Code) on a server and accessing it via mobile SSH clients like Termius.
- **The AI Keyboard Wrapper**: Using a dedicated AI-powered STT keyboard (Wispr Flow) to input natural language into standard terminal applications.
- **Urgency-Driven Prompting**: Using expressive, informal, and urgent language to communicate high-stakes intent to agents.
- **One-Click VPS Provisioning**: Creating simplified scripts or plugins to spin up agent-ready environments (e.g., the `claude-code-hetzner` plugin).

## Entities

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI-based AI agent for coding.
- **Wispr Flow**: An AI-powered voice dictation keyboard for iOS and macOS.
- **Termius**: A mobile-first SSH client and terminal emulator.
- **Hetzner**: A cloud provider frequently used for hosting developer VPS environments.
- **Tmux**: A terminal multiplexer used to keep agent sessions alive across mobile disconnects.
- **Tailscale**: Mentioned as a way to securely access web-based terminals without VPN overhead.
- **Other Tools**: Clawdbot, xtro.dev, and Slopus Happy (mentions of alternative or complementary mobile coding tools).

## Open questions / follow-ups

- How do users effectively handle transcription errors for specialized technical terms or proprietary variable names?
- What are the security and stability trade-offs of "yolo-editing" production code through a mobile interface?
- Can small-screen diff-reviewing be made ergonomic, or is it better to trust the agent for small production fixes?

## Next steps

- Explore the **Wispr Flow** + **Claude Code** workflow for internal developer productivity testing.
- Research the concept of **"Structural Emotion"** in agents and how it might influence deploy safety.
- Document the **VPS-Agent-SSH** pattern as a recommended approach for mobile "on-the-go" coding.
