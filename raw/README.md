# raw/

This folder stores **raw captures** (minimally processed) of external sources:
- web pages (HTML or extracted text)
- YouTube transcripts
- tweets/threads (rendered text)

Raw captures are intended to be **local-only** and are ignored by git.
This repo tracks only:

- `raw/README.md`
- `raw/.gitkeep`

Conventions are defined in `docs/distilation/distilation-pipeline.md`.
