# AI-Assisted Software Development

This repository is the public working area behind **ai-assisted-software-development.com**.

Its purpose is to collect, systematize, and evolve knowledge about **AI-assisted software development** — across the full software lifecycle: thinking, planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

The project is built **in public**. Ideas are refined over time, documents change, and assumptions are revisited. The history of the repository is part of the content.

## Repository roles

This repository is the **knowledge base** (source content).

The website is published from a separate “site” repository (planned: `ai-assisted-software-development-com`) that pulls this content and builds/deploys it.

## What this repository is

- A growing **knowledge base / wiki**
- A place to **publish notes, patterns, and mental models**
- A record of **experiments and workflows** for using AI in software development
- A companion to newsletters, talks, and short videos

## What this repository is not

- A polished course
- A static reference
- A collection of generic AI prompts

Clarity and usefulness matter more than completeness.

## How to read this repository

- Start with high-level concepts and principles
- Follow links to concrete examples and experiments
- Treat documents as snapshots of thinking at a given time

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal at the beginning.  
Structure, conventions, and content will evolve as understanding deepens.
